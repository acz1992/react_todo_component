# To Do Component

## Mission

-   Revise React
-   Create a component that I can integrate into later projects

## Concepts

-   useState() and useEffect() hooks
-   Modularization
-   Passing props
-   localStorage (.setItem/.getItem)

## Further notes:

-   While Component has been further modularized into three smaller components, I have kept the overall Todo component intact in EntireToDoApp.jsx, so that it can later be easily integrated into projects
